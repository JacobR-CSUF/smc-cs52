#### Objective: Write a program that asks the user to enter three positive integers (greater than 0) one at a time from the command line. The program then computes and prints the largest entered number. Use if-else statements to compare the three integers.
---
Sample Run:
```
Enter the first positive integer: 7
Enter the second positive integer: 3
Enter the third positive integer: 9
The largest number is: 9
```
Tasks:

1. Prompt the user to enter three positive integers one at a time.

2. Use if-else statements to compare the three integers and find the largest.

3. Print the largest number.

Guidelines:

* Ensure that the entered integers are positive (greater than 0). If a non-positive integer is entered, prompt the user to enter a valid number.

* Use meaningful variable names.

* Ensure proper indentation and code formatting.

* Include comments to explain your code.
